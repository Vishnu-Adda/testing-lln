# testing-lln
An R script to test the Law of Large Numbers.

rnorm() represents a normal distribution, with 0 in the middle. Using LLN, we'd expect the value generated by rnorm() to have a 68.2% chance of being between -1 and 1. This R Script tests that theory by dividing the total number between -1 to 1 by the total numbers generated.

Now has the Python version for it.
